    	between station number 9 and 10. Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, commonly shortened to Hogwarts,
    	is a British school of magic for students aged eleven to eighteen. The school is famous for having numerous
    	charms and spells on and around it that make it impossible for a Muggle to locate it. Muggles cannot see
    	the school; rather, they see only ruins and several warnings of danger."/>

            <h4>About Us</h4>
            <p>
            	Hogwarts is divided into four houses, each bearing the last name of its founder:<br>
            	<ul>
	                <li> Godric <b>Gryffindor</b> </li>
					<li> Salazar <b>Slytherin</b> </li>
					<li> Rowena <b>Ravenclaw</b> </li>
	                <li> Helga <b>Hufflepuff</b> </li>
	            </ul>
            	Throughout the school year, the houses compete for the House Cup, gaining and losing points
            	based on actions such as performance in class and rule violations. The house with the highest
            	end-of-year total wins and has its colours displayed in the Great Hall for the following school year.<br>
            	Each house also has its own Quidditch team that competes for the Quidditch Cup.
            	These two competitions breed rivalries between the houses.
            	Houses at Hogwarts are living and learning communities for their students.<br>
            	The primary mode of transport to Hogwarts is the Hogwarts Express that students
            	take at the start of each school year.<br>
            	Students board the train from the hidden Platform 9Â¾ at King's Cross station in London.<br>
            	The train arrives near Hogwarts, some time after nightfall.
            </p>

    	        The day begins at Hogwarts with breakfast in the Great Hall. Students sit at their own House table and can eat and socialise,<br>
    	        or finish homework. The Headmaster or Headmistress eats with the professors at the High Table placed at the far end of the hall.<br>
    	        During breakfast, owls bring in the student's post, generally consisting of The Daily Prophet, letters from parents or friends,<br>
    	        or packages from home. A bell signals the start of the first class of the morning at 9 am.<br><br>

				There are two long morning classes with a short break in between them for students to get to their next class.<br>
				After lunch, classes resume at 1 pm, and there is a break around afternoon teatime before another class period.<br>
				The classes are about one hour in length, with occasional double periods lasting two hours.<br>
				Classes end around five o'clock. First-year students get Friday afternoons off, while sixth- and seventh-year<br> 
				students have several free periods during the week. In the evening, students eat their dinner in the Great Hall,<br>
				after which they are expected to be in their common rooms.
