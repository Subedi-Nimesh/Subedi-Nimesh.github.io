      <div style="color: white;">  <h3>About Gurkhas:</h3>
        The Gurkhas or Gorkhas with endonym Gorkhali ar the soldiers of Nepalese nationality recruited in the British Army, 
        Nepalese Army, Indian Army, Gurkha Contigent Singapore, Gurkha Reserve Unit Brunei, UN Peace Keeping force, and war
        zones around the world. Historically, the terms "Gurkha" and "Gorkhali" were synonymous with "Nepali" and derived
        from the hill principality Gorkha Kingdom from which the Kingdom of Nepal expanded under Maharajadhiraj Prithivi
        Narayan Shah. The name may be traced to the medieval Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath who has a historic shrine
        in Gorkha. The word itself derived from Go-Raksha, raksha becoming rakha. Rakhawala means protector and is derived
        from rakshya as well. Gurkhas are closely associated with the Khukuri, a forward-curving Nepalese knife, and have a
        well known reputation for fearless military prowess. The former Indian Army Chief of Staff Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw
        once stated that "If a man says he is not afraid of dying, he is either lying or he is a Gurkha."
