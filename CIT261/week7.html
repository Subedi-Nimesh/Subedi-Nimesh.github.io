    <h1>Week 7 Journal</h1>
    <hr size="4" color="black">
    This week again we were not able to meet. This week I decided that I was going to learn on my own so 
    I went to our recordings of the meeting and then tried to do the topics on my own without any external help.
    We decided to communicate through text and decide what we were doing for next week.
