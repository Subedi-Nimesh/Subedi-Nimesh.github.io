    <h1>Week 8 Journal</h1>
    <hr size="4" color="black">
    We didn't do anything this week. We decided not to meet up either as we were all busy with the mid-term exams.
    We decided to bring some ideas for our final project and decide if that is a good project.
    We also decided to meet next week and then complete the last chapter together.
