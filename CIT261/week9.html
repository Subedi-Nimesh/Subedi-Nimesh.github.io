    <h1>Week 9 Journal</h1>
    <hr size="4" color="black">
    We met this week and taught AJAX together. I learned many things about how to connect to the server this week.
    We had decided to teach the same topic this week because we thought that this topic would be the hardest and 
    we want to understand it properly. So, we all taught the same topic.
