    <h1>Week 6 Journal</h1>
    <hr size="4" color="black">
    This week didn't go as planned, we were not able to meet as a group and teach all the topics that were assigned.
    I was prepared to teach Designing, Defining, and Triggering CSS3 Transitions without Custom Libraries but i didn't.
    We decided to communicate through text and decide what we were doing for next week.
