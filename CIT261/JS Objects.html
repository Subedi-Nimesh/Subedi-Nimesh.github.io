    JavaScript variables are containers for data values.<br>
    Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.<br>
    The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).<br>
    Objects can also have methods.<br>
    Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.<br>
    In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.<br><br>

    <div id="text"></div><br><br>
    The above text was created using JavaScript Objects.<br><br>
    The code for it is:<br>

    var owner = {<br>
    firstName   : "Nimesh",<br>
    lastName    : "Subedi",<br>
    age         : 21,<br>
    hometown    : "Kathmandu",<br>
    country     : "Nepal",<br>
    major       : "Software Engineering",<br>
    college     : "BYU-Idaho",<br>
    };<br><br>
    function onLoad() {<br>
    let info = `Hi, My Name is ${owner.firstName} ${owner.lastName}, I am ${owner.age} years old.<br>
    I was born in ${owner.hometown}, ${owner.country}. I am currently studying ${owner.major} in ${owner.college}.
    It was nice to meet you.`;<br>
    document.getElementById("text").innerHTML = info;<br>
    }<br><br><br>
  </div>
